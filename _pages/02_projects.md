## Project descriptions:

### - Epigenetic database and analyses (2019)
Currently, I am involved in various international studies that have (or plan to) collect data on epigenetics with association with psycholgical measures, and which were supervised by Prof. Emeritus Thomas Elbert. I am building and maintaining a database of those studies at the University of Konstanz, where they are stored. My tasks are to centralize, integrate and manage the data of over 10 studies in 8 countries in Africa and Latin America. The abovementioned studies measured violence and psychological outcomes, such as depression, aggression and PTSD in relation to Narrative Therapy Exposure (NET).

### - THL Android App (2018)
Development of a portable tool to be used for data collection in fieldwork settings, specifically focused on one instrument used to evaluate threats to social integrity (THL by Köbach et al. 2016). This project was funded by a small grant of c. 5,000 €, which I received from the _Zukunftskolleg_ of the University of Konstanz. The original plan was to develop a digital version as an alternative to traditional paper-version instruments, with the aim to optimize studies, by allowing data to be gathered, stored and formated more efficiently (automatically), reducing the costs of additional data control (such as time-consuming data cleaning and data wrangling). Digital, and thus more portable, instrument versions would also reduce paper waste and transport costs.
