The way we commonly see the world, following our ideals, is usually to think that we can plan our lifes until the point that we have everything set to a perfect scenario. We have passions and consequently life goals. I am not different. I have always had a dream of becoming a scientist and help making new discoveries or help protecting rainforests and nature, specially given that I come from a country with high biodiversity. 

Life is hard, however, and on the way I faced several adversities. Contrary to many friends and colleagues who decided to step down from academia, I still resist. Against the odds, I completed a PhD in Ecology and for few years now I have worked with science moving from quite different research fields (botany, systematics, ecologyâ€¦), until I recently ended in doing trauma research (psychology!). My passion for science and programming made me who I am now.

Despite seeing science much more critically and with less passion (in a romantic puerile way) now, due to some issues I personally see in how science is carried out, to say a few, the reproducibility crises or the flawed enslaving publication system, I still believe in science and in what I do.
