<p style='text-align: justify;'> I dreamed of becoming a scientist since childhood. I wanted to make discoveries and help save the rainforests. I never actually knew how to get there, but after studying Biology for over several years I indeed managed to be a scientist. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> I completed a PhD in Ecology and for few years now I have worked with science moving from quite different research fields (botany, systematics, ecologyâ€¦), until I recently ended up doing trauma research (on Psychology). My passion for science and programming made me who I am now. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> I believe that science should be done for the greater good of our societies and not for the ego of few people. Therefore, I personally disagree at some degree in how science is carried out nowadays, for instance when we look at the reproducibility crisis or at the flawed publication system. However, I still believe in science and in what I do. </p>
