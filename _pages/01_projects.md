List of recent projects which I am or was involved with.

### Epigenetics of mental disorders (2019-now)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
I am involved in various international studies that had collected data on epigenetics in association with psychological measures (particularly trauma related mental disorders). I am building and maintaining a database of epigenetic data related to those studies at the University of Konstanz. My tasks are to centralize, integrate and manage the data of over 10 studies in 8 countries in Africa and Latin America. The abovementioned studies measured violence and psychological outcomes, such as depression, aggression and PTSD which can be related to epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation. Lately, I was granted funding (2021) to analyze a male dataset of violence perpetrators from DRC.

### Narrative Exposure Therapy effectiveness (2017-ongoing)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
The main line of research in the research group I work of Prof. Thomas Elbert focus on the development and evaluation of NET. Clinical studies have been conducted in different contexts and with different populations in that purpose. NET is a well-established psychotherapy that deals with trauma-related mental disorders. Much research, however, is still needed to test several aspects, such as the possibility of scaling NET or the identification of epigenetic biomarkers associated with NET. My main contributions have been to the following projects:
<ul>
<li style="font-size:13px">Narrative Exposure Therapy for traumatized offenders in North Kivu, DRC</li>
<li style="font-size:13px">Narrative Exposure Therapy vs. treatment as usual in trauma survivors, Brazil</li>
</ul>

### THL Android App (2018)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
Development of a portable tool to be used for data collection in fieldwork settings, specifically focused on one instrument used to evaluate the threats to human social integrity (THL by Köbach et al. 2016). This project was funded by a small grant of c. 5,000 €, which I received from the **Zukunftskolleg** of the University of Konstanz. The original plan was to develop a digital version of the original paper-version instrument, with the aim to optimize studies by allowing data to be gathered, stored and formatted more efficiently (automatically). The objective was to reduce the costs of additional data control (such as time-consuming data cleaning and data wrangling), paper waste or transportation.

### Selfing mating system evolution (2013-2017)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
This project was the core of my PhD studies (before Psychology, I was working with Plant Biology). I conducted a series of experiments to test and verify the evolution of selfing (mating system) in plants. For this I analyzed several aspects (floral morphology, inbreeding depression, pollination) of plants from selfing and outcrossing populations. After a classical formation in plant ecology and evolution, I learned the basis for programming and statistical analysis. I was funded by the CNPq (Brazil).
