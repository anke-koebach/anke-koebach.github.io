List of recent projects which I am or was involved with.

### - Epigenetic database and analyses (2019-now)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
Currently, I am involved in various international studies that have (or plan to) collect data on epigenetics with association with psychological measures, and which were supervised by Prof. Emeritus Thomas Elbert. I am building and maintaining a database of those studies at the University of Konstanz, where they are stored. My tasks are to centralize, integrate and manage the data of over 10 studies in 8 countries in Africa and Latin America. The abovementioned studies measured violence and psychological outcomes, such as depression, aggression and PTSD in relation to Narrative Therapy Exposure (NET).

### - THL Android App (2018)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
Development of a portable tool to be used for data collection in fieldwork settings, specifically focused on one instrument used to evaluate threats to social integrity (THL by Köbach et al. 2016). This project was funded by a small grant of c. 5,000 €, which I received from the **Zukunftskolleg** of the University of Konstanz. The original plan was to develop a digital version as an alternative to traditional paper-version instruments, with the aim to optimize studies, by allowing data to be gathered, stored and formatted more efficiently (automatically), reducing the costs of additional data control (such as time-consuming data cleaning and data wrangling). Digital, and thus more portable, instrument versions would also reduce paper waste and transport costs.

### - Research on the effectiveness of Narrative Exposure Therapy [NET] (2017-ongoing)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
The main line of research in the research group I work (Prof. Thomas Elbert) focus on the development and evaluation of NET. Clinical studies have been conducted in different contexts and with different populations in that purpose. NET is a well-established psychotherapy that deals with trauma-related mental disorders. Hopwever, much research is still needed to test several aspects, such as the possibility of scaling NET or the identification of epigenetic biomarkers associated with NET. My main contributions have been to the following projects:
- Narrative Exposure Therapy for traumatized offenders in North Kivu
- Effect of Narrative Exposure Therapy versus treatment as usual in a sample of trauma survivors who live under ongoing threat: a randomized controlled trial in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

### - Selfing mating system evolution (2013-2017)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
This project was the core of my PhD. I conducted a series of experiments indoors and at a botanical garden to test and verify the evolution of selfing (mating system) in plants. For this I analyzed several aspects (floral morphology, inbreeding depression, pollination) of plants from selfing and outcrossing populations. After a classical formation in plant ecology and evolution, I learned the basis for programming and statistical analysis. I was funded by the CNPq (Brazil).
