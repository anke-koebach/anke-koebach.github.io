<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
Compilation of platforms and software for data analysis and scientific research.<br>
(ongoing work)
</p>

#### Platforms & environments
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
These tools help gather several programs and/or major packages into one single pot; some are web-based. IDEs are good alternatives that combine a user-interface layout with powerful programs/programming languages.

gene ontology
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
Gene ontology terms are used to standardize and facilitate a common language in genetics. <em>"An ontology is a formal representation of a body of knowledge within a given domain. Ontologies usually consist of a set of classes (or terms or concepts) with relations that operate between them. The Gene Ontology (GO) describes our knowledge of the biological domain with respect to... molecular functions (MF), biological processes (BP) and cellular components (CP)..."</em> (taken from official  website) <a href="http://geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology - Unifying Biology</a>

#### Software & packages
##### Management
openBIS
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
Laboratory notebook and inventory manager. It help organize all sorts of information about experimental studies, particularly focused on laboratory studies. <a href="https://openbis.ch/">openBIS</a>
</p>

##### Workflows
snakemake
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
<em>"The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition. Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment."</em> (taken from official  website) <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">snakemake</a>
</p>

workflowr
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
<em>"The workflowr R package helps researchers organize their analyses in a way that promotes effective project management, reproducibility, collaboration, and sharing of results. Workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing time-stamped, versioned, and documented results. Any R user can quickly and easily adopt workflowr."</em> (taken from official  website) <a href="https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/">workflowr</a>
