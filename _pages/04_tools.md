<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
List of software (for now, alphabetically ordered) that are important tools for data science & research. This is an ongoing work.
</p>


## Data analysis
### Snakemake workflow management system
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
<em>"The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition. Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment."</em> (taken from official  website)

</p>

### workflowr (R package)
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
<em>"The workflowr R package helps researchers organize their analyses in a way that promotes effective project management, reproducibility, collaboration, and sharing of results. Workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing time-stamped, versioned, and documented results. Any R user can quickly and easily adopt workflowr."</em> (taken from official  website)

## Research
### Connected papers: tool for literature reviews
<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
Give a specific paper and see what it comes out of it in terms of publication citations and connections between papers. Visual appealing and intuitive.
