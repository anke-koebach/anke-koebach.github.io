<p>Great! For some reason you landed here!</p>

My name is Samuel Carleial Fernandes. I am a biologist who likes nature, science and programming. Here is my professional website, where you may find all relevant information about my work and other stuff.</p>

Take a look at my projects (next pages) and curriculum (below). If you are interested in my work or if you need support on data analysis, contact me by e-mail!</p>

I dreamed of becoming a scientist since childhood. I wanted to make discoveries and help save the rainforests. I never actually knew how to get there, but after studying Biology for over several years I indeed managed to be a scientist.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px" style='text-align: justify;'>
I completed a PhD in Ecology and for few years now I have worked with science moving from quite different research fields (botany, systematics, ecologyâ€¦), until I recently ended up doing trauma research (on Psychology). My passion for science and programming made me who I am now.</p>
