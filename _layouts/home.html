<b style="font-size:35px">Hi !</b>

<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
I am a biologist who likes nature, reading, science and programming.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px" style='text-align: justify;'>
Becoming a scientist was my dream since childhood, as I wanted to make discoveries and help save the rainforests. I never actually knew how to get there, but I started studying Biology and after several years I managed to be a scientist indeed.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px" style='text-align: justify;'>
My path in science took me into quite different research fields, namely from botany, systematics and ecology to clinical trials, mental health and epigenetics. My passion for science and computers made me who I am now.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px" align="justify">
So, here is my website. Here you may find relevant information about my work, but also other stuff too. On the next pages, take a look at my projects and collaborations. Further, I have a list of different information sources and software for data analyses. If you are interested in my work or if you need support on your research/study, please contact me by e-mail.</p>
