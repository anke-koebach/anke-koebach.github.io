# Biography

I am originally from Northeastern Brazil, where I graduated in Biology. After my Master's Degree and PhD in Plant Ecology, I now currently work in mental health research. Today, I am a post-doc research assistant and data analyst working in the research group of Prof. Elbert at the University of Konstanz, Germany. I have a strong interest in scientific research, especially on plant ecology and evolution, floral biology and plant-animal interactions. Generally, I am interested in data science, computer tools for data analysis, data visualization and statistics.
